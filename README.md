Belter Creole Crash Course

# Phonology
The pronunciation of most letters seems to be the same as in english, except for 'x', that sounds like 'kh'.
*Special cases*:
 - 'ch' -"**ch**eck"
 - 'dzh' -"**j**ump"
 - 'ng' -"si**ng**" (**g** is dropped)
 - 'ny' -"ca**ny**on"
 - 'ow' -"th**ough**t" or "n**o**t"
 - 'sh' -"**sh**eep"
 - 'x' -"**h**ere"

# Articles
"wa" -"*a*", "*an*
"da" -"*the*"

# Pronouns
|     | Singular     | Plural                |
|-----|--------------|-----------------------|
| 1st | mi (I)       | milowda (we)          |
| 2nd | to (you)     | tolowda (you)         |
| 3rd | im (they/it) | imalowda, imim (they) |

# Tenses
Belter Creole has 3 tenses: past, present, future. All of them are constructed via special modifiers that are placed before the verb.
|         | Belter | English equivalent |
|---------|--------|--------------------|
| past    | ta     | did or -ed         |
| present | -      | do or -            |
| future  | gonya  | going to, will     |

# Grammatical Aspects
Very similar to tenses (constructed via modifiers too), but instead of the time of the action they denote its behavior (don't know how to explain, but you'll get it, just go further).

| habitual   | tili    | present simple (smth that happens regularly) |

keting = what
kewe = how
kéweting = what kind/type
kéradzhang = why, for what reason

# Ischenko's extension
Due to the lack of the words in the language, I propose a new keyword -"wu" (pronounced like "vu"). If you want to use some english word, that currently has no translation in Belter Creole, you can use that english word directly in your speech, but "wu" must be placed after it.
For example, "knights of nigts" would be "knihgts wu fo nax".
